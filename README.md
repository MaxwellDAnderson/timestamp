# Timestamp

This repository contains the files for a lightweight, still-in-development timekeeping program called Timestamp.

### The Concept

A lightweight word processing program that generates a fresh timestamp upon the press of the "Enter" key.

### The Vision

The beauty of Timestamp will be its simplicity. Upon starting the program, the user will be greeted with:

> [timestamp]: ---START OF DOCUMENT---

From here, the user will hit enter for a new timestamp on the next line and begin to write.

To signal the end of the document, the user will enter "\\\\\\", which will generate:

> [timestamp]: ---END OF DOCUMENT---

The first and last timestamps (in addition to all of the other timestamps, of course) will help ensure the integrity of the resulting file.

### The Inspiration

Not too long ago, I viewed the Daily Diaries of President Reagan and marveled at the temporal precision with which the President's days were documented. I have since become more temporally conscientious. But keeping a log similar to that of the President is difficult, because, unlike the President, most people do not have an archivist following them around to document their activities. This means any such time record will, in most cases, be self-made. A self-made record of this type presents its own issues. Indeed, by the time one checks the time and writes the time down, a new thing to log has come up, making one constantly needing to play catch-up. The constant catch-up playing leads to one generally feeling "rushed," a disastrous situation for one who seeks to keep a well-documented record of activities. Timestamp seeks to resolve this inherent tension by allowing the user to focus exclusively on the substantive content of the record.

### Possible Uses

The initial use I envisioned when I began this project was in the legal profession. There are obviously billable hours that must be tallied. However, there are also several nonobvious uses that transcend the legal profession.

Timestamp could be used for notetaking during meetings. The resulting file would be a hyper-detailed play-by-play of the meeting down to the microsecond. The ease of generating a new timestamp could also assist one with noting the arrival times of the meeting participants.

Another use could be in law enforcement, another profession uniquely in need of accurate temporal records. I could envision, for example, a law enforcement official on a stakeout using Timestamp to keep detailed records of observations. In movies and tv shows, law enforcement officials are depicted as using audio recordings in the form of voice memoranda to record their observations. To the extent that any of those depictions are remotely accurate, Timestamp would be a good alternative, because it would eliminate the need for later transcriptions of these observations.

### Delta Release

The Delta Release is the bare bones concept of the program, which is at this moment still a console program. I intend to develop a full graphical user interface for Timestamp.
